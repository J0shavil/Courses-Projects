Runoff Problem (CS50x)

This was one of the most challenging problems of the course, but the more challenging something is, the more you learn while solving it.

This program simulates a runoff election in which a voter gets to set ranks for their candidates. The program then checks which candidate has the most preference over the other candidates to determine the winner.
