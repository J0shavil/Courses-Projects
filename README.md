Mario problem (Cs50x)

I decided to include this problem in my portfolio because, when I solved this problem using C, that's when I realized I love programming. That sense of acomplishment when I saw those "#" forming the pyramid within the specs demanded, was amazing.

Then later when I revisitted it with python it was clear how powerfull and intuitive this language can be.

You'll have to import the following libraries: 

- Cs50 library for C: https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/
- Cs50 library for python: https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/python/



Feel free to try the code yourself!
