Ecommerce website Project

This project was done in the CS50's WebDevelopment with Python and Javascript

This website was created with Django.

It has features that enables the user to:
- Create a listing with title, description, value of the item and item Category
- Add/remove active items to a watchlist
- Post a bid to a giving auction
- If the user created the auction it can close it and the user who posted the highest bid wins the Auction
- The user can filter the listings by category
- Add comments to listings



This project gave me solid knowledge on how a ecommerce site works and further developped my understanding of the django framework.
